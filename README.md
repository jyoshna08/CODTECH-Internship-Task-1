## Overview of the project

### Project: Basic Calculator Using Java Programming

### Overview of the Project

This Java program serves as a basic calculator. It interacts with the user to input two numbers and select an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). Then, it performs the chosen operation and displays the result to the user. This project aims to demonstrate fundamental Java programming concepts such as user input, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic operations.

### Introduction

Welcome to the Basic Calculator project! This project provides a simple yet functional calculator implemented in Java. Users can perform basic arithmetic calculations with ease using this program. Let's dive into the details of how this calculator works and the technologies used to build it.

### Objective

The objective of this project is to create a user-friendly Java program that acts as a basic calculator. It should allow users to input two numbers, select an operation, perform the calculation, and display the result accurately.

### Key Activities and Technologies Used

**User Input Handling: Utilize the Scanner class to receive input from the user.**
**Arithmetic Operations: Implement addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.**
**Conditional Statements: Use if-else or switch statements to perform the selected operation.**
**Console Output: Display the result of the calculation to the user via the console.**
**Java Programming: Develop the entire project using the Java programming language.**

### About This Task

In this task, we aim to create a basic calculator in Java that performs four arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user will be prompted to input two numbers and choose an operation. The program will then execute the selected operation and output the result to the user. To ensure the successful execution of this task, it's essential to understand the core concepts of Java programming, including variables, data types, operators, conditional statements, and user input/output. Additionally, familiarity with the Scanner class for user input handling and basic arithmetic operations is crucial. This project provides an excellent opportunity to practice these fundamental Java programming skills and enhance your problem-solving abilities.

### Conclusion

In this project, i have developed a basic calculator using Java, demonstrating essential programming concepts such as user input handling, arithmetic operations, and conditional statements. The project serves as an excellent introduction to Java programming, providing hands-on experience in building a functional console-based application. By completing this task, we've reinforced our understanding of Java's core features and enhanced our problem-solving skills.

This calculator not only performs fundamental arithmetic operations but also illustrates how to create an interactive program that communicates with users effectively. The skills gained from this project are foundational and will be beneficial for tackling more complex programming challenges in the future.
